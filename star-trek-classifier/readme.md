# Star Trek Image Classifier

To replicate this project, first run the image_downloading.py script from the star-trek-classifier directory.

This will create a folder named "downloads" and additional folders within that folder named for each of the keyword combinations
 listed in the image downloading argument.

From there, you can run the image_organizing file to divide these images into their respective train and valid folders by class.
